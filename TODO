TODO

General
    Flip grid visualization on the NW-SW axis
!	Decide on implementing simulation-specific cell and grid classes
	Find way to hide grid data structure
	Pick better colors for GameOfLife, Percolation, and Segregation (check Fire contrast)
	Implement way to display color key
	Add UI input for simulation parameters
	Make simulation completely stop if it has reached its end state (no more steps)
	Make it so simulation can run indefinitely without crashing
	Fix double-click glitches
?    Remove unnecessary javadoc comments
    Check line breaks in javadoc comments
	Determine if we need to write simulation rules in the comments

Cell
	Determine best value for undetermined next state (currently -1)

Fire
?    Determine if I need to implement extra rules
?    Determine if I need to always start with only trees and one burning tree in the center

PredatorPrey
    Make it so moving and eating occur in random order (currently eating first)
	Determine whether I should use the willEat instance variable or call makeSharkEat() from determineCellBehaviors()

GameOfLife
    Implement end state

Segregation
	Implement end state
