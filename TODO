TODO

General
    Flip grid visualization on the NW-SW axis
	Decide on implementing simulation-specific cell and grid classes
	Find way to hide grid structure
	Pick better colors for GameOfLife, Percolation, and Segregation (check Fire contrast)
	Implement way to display color key
	Add UI input for simulation parameters
	Make simulation completely stop if it has reaches its end state (no more steps)
	Fix double-click glitches
1    Remove unnecessary javadoc comments
	Determine if we need to write simulation rules in the comments

Cell
	Determine best value for undetermined next state (currently -1)

Fire
2    Determine if I need to implement extra rules
3    Determine if I need to always start with only trees and one burning tree in the center

PredatorPrey
    Determine if
	Determine whether I should use the willEat instance variable or call makeSharkEat() from determineCellBehaviors()
	Determine if iterating through animalTurnTracker is random enough
	Check performance

GameOfLife
    Implement end state

Segregation
	Implement end state
