TODO

General
    Clean up metadata passing
	Decide on implementing simulation-specific cell and grid classes
	Find way to hide grid structure
	Pick better colors for GameOfLife, Percolation, and Segregation (check Fire contrast)
	Implement way to display color key
	Add UI input for simulation parameters
	Make simulation completely stop if it has reaches its end state (no more steps)
	Remove unnecessary javadoc comments
	Determine if we need to write simulation rules in the comments

Cell
	Determine best value for undetermined next state (currently -1)

Fire
    Implement end state
    Determine if I need to always start with only trees and one burning tree in the center
    Determine if I need to implement extra rules

PredatorPrey
    Determine which breeding behavior I should use (assignment or wiki)
	Determine why empty cells tend to show up on the right side

GameOfLife
    Implement end state

Segregation
	Implement end state
