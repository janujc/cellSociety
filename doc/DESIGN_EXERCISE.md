### Exercise 1: RPS
We can have one superclass called _Destroyer_ that has generic functions that are common to all destroyers.
These include: _attack()_ which returns a boolean value corresponding to whether or not the attack was successful,

### Exercise 3: Cell Society
How does a Cell know what rules to apply for its simulation?

How does a Cell know about its neighbors? How can it update itself without effecting its neighbors update?

What is the grid? Does it have any behaviors? Who needs to know about it?

What information about a simulation needs to be the configuration file?

How is the GUI updated after all the cells have been updated?
